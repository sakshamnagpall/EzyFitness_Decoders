// Home Page

//1. User: This struct stores the user's name, body mass index (BMI), calories burned, and step count.
//2. Activity: This struct stores the name, duration, and unit of a fitness activity. For example, you could create an Activity instance to represent the user's morning yoga session (name: "Morning Yoga", duration: 20, unit: "minutes").

// Activity Page


//1. Activity: This struct stores the name, value and unit of a fitness activity metric. For example, you could create an Activity instance to represent the user's steps (name: "Steps", value: 10432, unit: "steps").

//2. Ring: This struct stores the name, current value, and goal of a fitness metric that can be displayed in a circular progress ring. For example, you could create a Ring instance to represent the user's active calories burned (name: "Active Calories", value: 498, goal: (optional)).

// Achievement Page

// 1. Activity: This struct stores the name and count of a fitness activity. For example, you could create an Activity instance to represent the user's step count (name: "Steps", count: 10432).
// 2. Achievement: This struct stores the name, image name, and description of a fitness achievement. For example, you could create an Achievement instance to represent the "Close Your Rings 7 Days in a Row" achievement (name: "Close Your Rings 7 Days in a Row", imageName: "seven_rings_achievement", description: "Earn this badge by closing your Activity rings for 7 days in a row").
//3. FitnessData: This struct stores the user's fitness data, including their strike count, current level, days remaining until they reach the next level, and a list of badges they have earned.
